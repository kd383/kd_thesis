Spectral algorithms provide an appealing alternative for identifying
interpretable low\hyp{}rank subspaces by simple factorizations of
higher\hyp{}order moments. But this simplicity is also a weakness: violations of
modeling assumptions destroy performance unless they are handled through
rectification, and the size of the moment matrices limits us to small
vocabularies. In this chapter, we developed an efficient and scalable framework:
Low\hyp{}Rank Joint Stochastic Matrix Factorization. We provide theoretical
advances in compressed matrix factorization, leading to high\hyp{}quality
low\hyp{}rank non\hyp{}negative approximations without quadratic blowup. The
method provides orders of magnitude speedups for rectification even on small
vocabularies. Perhaps most importantly, we can now apply reliable,
high\hyp{}quality factorizations of high\hyp{}dimensional data sets on 
laptop\hyp{}grade hardware, massively increasing the applicability and potential
use of these algorithms.
