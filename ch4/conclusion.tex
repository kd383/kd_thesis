Spectral algorithms provide an appealing alternative for identifying
interpretable low-rank subspaces by simple factorizations of higher-order
moments. But this simplicity is also a weakness: violations of modeling
assumptions destroy performance unless they are handled through rectification,
and the size of the moment matrices limits us to small vocabularies. In this
paper, we developed an efficient and scalable framework: Low-Rank Joint
Stochastic Matrix Factorization. We provide theoretical advances in compressed
matrix factorization, leading to high-quality low-rank non-negative
approximations without quadratic blowup. The method provides orders of magnitude
speedups for rectification even on small vocabularies. Perhaps most importantly,
we can now apply reliable, high-quality factorizations of high-dimensional data
sets on laptop-grade hardware, massively increasing the applicability and
potential use of these algorithms.
